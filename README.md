# ddgs-shell
DDGS (duck duck go search) shell in python with extended functionality
## About
So you know how you can't exclude words from a search in duckduckgo? That's annoying, right? No longer shall we suffer from this oppression! So anyway that was the point of the entire project.
## Tutorial
`!e` applies retroactively! It doesn't need to be set before searching! You can also reset it to get the original results.
## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, or check if your package manager provides "rich" because... it probably does.
## TODO
Write examples because rn I don't think the usage is obvious

That's it.
